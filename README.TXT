   PROJECT TITLE: Minesweeper
   
   PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
   This program is a game that display a board which is divided into a grid and “mines” are hidden under
   some grid cells. The player’s task is to determine where all the mines are without causing
   them to explode. If the player clicks on a grid cell and it contains a mine, the mine ex-
   plodes, ending the game. To make the game remotely winnable, when a grid cell is clicked
   on and there is no mine, the cell is labeled with the number of neighboring cells that do
   have a mine. From this, the player can often learn more about the location of mines, and
   place a flag on the locations where mines are believed to exist. The goal of the game is to
   find all the mines without causing any of them to explode.
